# Alarm Clock

This is a simple alarm clock program implemented in Python. It allows you to set an alarm time and will notify you with a sound when the alarm goes off.

## Features

- Set an alarm time using the 24-hour format.
- Display the current time and date.
- Play a sound when the alarm time is reached.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alarm-clock.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd alarm-clock
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `alarm_clock.py` script:

   ```shell
   python alarm_clock.py
   ```

2. Enter the alarm time in the format `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., 07:30:45).

3. The current time and date will be displayed.

4. When the alarm time is reached, a sound will play to notify you.

5. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the alarm.

## Configuration

You can customize the alarm sound by replacing the `alarm_sound.wav` file in the `sounds` directory with your preferred audio file. Make sure the new file has the same name (`alarm_sound.wav`) to ensure compatibility.

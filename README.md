Alarm Clock GUI Application

This project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) based Alarm Clock application built using Python's tkinter library. The app allows users to set an alarm by entering the desired time in 24-hour format (hour, minute, and second) and play a sound when the alarm time is reached.

Features:


Set alarm time: Users can input the alarm time using the hour, minute, and second fields.
Play alarm sound: When the alarm time matches the current time, the app will trigger an audio alarm.
Easy-to-use interface: The application provides a user-friendly GUI to interact with the alarm settings.


Requirements:


Python 3.x
tkinter (usually comes with standard Python installations)
pygame library (to play audio)


How to use:



Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the pygame library if you haven't already: pip install pygame
Run the alarm_clock.py script to launch the application.
Enter the desired alarm time in the hour, minute, and second fields.
Click the "Set Alarm" button to set the alarm.
Once the set alarm time is reached, the app will play the specified alarm sound (provided the audio file 'alarm.wav' exists in the same directory).


Important Notes:


The alarm sound file 'alarm.wav' should be placed in the same directory as the alarm_clock.py script.
Please ensure your computer's audio is not muted, and the volume is set to an audible level.
